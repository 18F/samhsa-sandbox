This is our dog **Arizona**. She is about 11 months old, and came from [Morgan's Mutts](https://morgansmuttsrescue.org/), a rescue shelter outside of Charlottesville. Her and her siblings were left at the animal control nearby and were luckily transferred to the shelter. The woman at the shelter named all of the puppies after characters from Grey's Anatomy, and since I'm from Arizona it seemed meant to be :dog:

### Favorite activities
